Class:

It is a reusable component. It is recommend to declare classes as public.


Object:
It is real world entity which exist physically.
It is instance for a class.


How to create objects/instances:
===============================

	syn:             ClassName c =       new  ClassName();
			 ParentClassName c =       new  ClassName();

	Ex:   Employee e1 = new Employee();
	     Object   o1 = new Employee(); // runtime polymorphism	






class Object{



	public Object(){
		// logic to create instance for a class
		// logic to generate hashcode
		// logic  to create copy of instance vars
		// logic to initialize instance vars with default value.
		// allocating memory in Heap...

	}


  boolean    equals(); // which compares ref/object hashcode for 2 diff objects
  String   toString(); // it is responsible to print hashcode generated by  jvm
