String API:
------------
String is a class in Java which provides set of methods to deal with string data.
String is a final class , no body can extends it.
String is Immutable in nature (cannot be changed or modify)

String is nothing but sequence of characters

In c-lang string is represented as char[] = {'h','e','l','l','o'};

syn1:-        String name = "king";
syn2:-         String city = new String("Banglore");

String methods are:

equals(): it compares to string values
toString(): it prints string self value and also it convert any object into string format

concat()
toUpperCase()
toLowerCase()

==========================================================

 StringBuffer ---> Thread safe , we cannot use it for multi threading

 StringBuilder --> Not Thread safe , we can use it for multi threading

Both are Mutable in Nature , we can modify them.






final keyword:

final int  X = 100;

	X = 200;//invalid

final class A {

 public final void m1(){

	}

}


class B extends A{ // invalid bcz final class cannot be inherited

 public void m1(){  // invalid

 }


}
