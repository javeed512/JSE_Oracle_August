Types of variables in Java:
----------------------------
1. Local variables
2. Instance variables
3. static variables

Local variables:
----------------
A variable declare inside any block or methods or constructor or their parameters are consider as 
local variables.
Local variable values cannot be initialize by JVM , its our reponsibility to initialize values.

Instance variables:
---------------------
Variables declare inside class outside all the methods or blocks  without static keyword.
Instance variables memory will be allocated inside Heap memory by JVM and also JVM will initialize default values to instance variables.
In Java  a seperate copy of instance variable will be assign to every indiviual objects.

Instance variables , can be access using class object or reference. That's why instance variables also known as object-level variables.
